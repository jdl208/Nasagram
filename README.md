# Nasagram
This website has a connection with tha api from NASA. It's a small, easy digestable website which shows 3 kinds of pictures related to space.
* An astronomy photo of the day.
* A picture of earth.
* Pictures taken by the Mars Rovers. 

## UX
I wanted to make a website with minimal scrolling. So it focusses immediatly on the pictures. When you go to another section, The latest picture made by that camera will immediatly be there.
